## Credits

- The script is a fork of ArchTitus, however modified for my needs and only with a server install or my personal i3wm rice. (I might also readd hyprland, if I get it to work with my Nvidia GPU)
- Original packages script was a post install cleanup script called ArchMatic located here: https://github.com/rickellis/ArchMatic
- Thank you to all the folks that helped during the creation from YouTube Chat! Here are all those Livestreams showing the creation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMCtkDIhe8&list=PLc7fktTRMBowNaBTsDHlL6X3P3ViX3tYg>
